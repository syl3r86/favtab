## Notice for Sheet Developers
If you are developing a sheet and want to strictly disable favtab for your sheet, you can do that by including `blockFavTab=true` in your sheet classes options (in the `static get defaultOptions` function for example). You can see this implementation in my Better NPC Sheet (https://github.com/syl3r86/BetterNPCSheet5e/blob/master/betternpcsheet.js line 34).

Favtab will also check if the nessessary html elements are present to ensure compability.
